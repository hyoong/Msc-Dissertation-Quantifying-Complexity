# Msc-Dissertation-Quantifying-Complexity

My thesis for my MSc course in Theoretical Physics at the University of Edinburgh.

The objective of this paper is to introduce the read the notion of quantum complexity. 
The following is an excerpt from the introduction:

"
This dissertation aims to provide the reader a basic notion of quantum complexity from
three different perspectives. There exists discernible connections at a fundamental level
among these perspectives which will be explored in the subsequent chapters. The content
and level of this paper is aimed towards readers with some undergraduate knowledge in
quantum mechanics and mathematics. We will state some important ideas and theorems
from a few selected papers by some key physicists in the field of quantum information
and quantum complexity, and then expand upon the ideas discussed. We also provide
proof of an important theorem in Chapter 4 and discuss the significance of it. In Chapter
5, we shall discuss the ideas and concepts of quantum complexity geometry

The quantum complexity of a unitary transformation or quantum state is defined as the
size of the shortest quantum computation that executes the unitary or prepares the state.
Quantum complexity is also defined as the inherent hardness or difficulty of a quantum
computational problem. It can also be seen as costs or a measure of resources i.e energy,
time and entanglement required to solve problems. Therefore, quantum complexity is
imperative in the design and build of quantum computers since it allows us to quantify
the viability, scale and resources needed in implementing quantum computations.
